 David:
    Takes a long time to get to any reviews
    Review system is not super helpful
    It’s only useful if you already know what restaurant you’re going to

Samantha
    Home page: not obvious how to search right away
    Have user reviews sooner
    An overall restaurant review would be useful
    Not obvious how to add review (plus button)
    Swipe down on reviews rather than sideways more natural 
    Review card layout confusing, e.g. expects names on top


Restaurant owner:
App idea:

-Having a most popular/most valuable selection of dishes at the top of menu may 
be useful to prevent information overwhelm 


Feedback on idea:

The restaurant owner said that the core idea of reviews for individual dishes 
within the menu was a good idea, though he said it was more suitable for the 
younger generation (our target audience). 

In terms of dish search, he said that as the current idea stands 
(searching for an individual dish), it would be more appropriate and useful for
individual people eating out. It would be less useful for groups as different
people would want different dishes. He suggested expanding the search to 
potentially include several dishes at once, as well as having a variety of
criteria such as price, proximity etc.

He seemed most interested in a potential business side, where we could provide
analytics of a restaurant’s dishes and provide it to the restaurant owner. 
For example if there are common complaints or points of inconsistency. He
mentioned this would be especially useful for large chains in their R&D efforts, 
as well as for quality control. He said that restaurant owners are always 
looking for user feedback to improve their business, but conventional methods of
data collection such as paper surveys do not provide data on a large scale or 
provide easily accessible analytics.
