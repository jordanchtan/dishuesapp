Jiahao:
    - UI Improvement is a good thing
    - Really likes swipeable menu
    - Menu header needs improvement to recenter the titles
    - Latest/Most Helpful button is awkward, putting it at the top may be better

Metrics at Rocca:
    Time taken from searching for restaurant to just before add review (i.e time taken reviewing the available dishes).
    
    initial timings:
        User 1 (Vegetarian): 01:12
        User 2 : 00:46
        
    Iteration 1:
        User 1 (Vegetarian): 00:57
        User 3: 00:43
        
    Iteration 2:
        User 4: 00:44
        
    Considerations:
        - Lack of suitable reviews
        - Small sample size
        - Different personalities/people
